**Airbnb Price Prediction Project**

Deep Learning was an indigestible field when I first encountered it during my journey to, hopefully, becoming a Data Scientist. The reason why I initially and biasedly assumed its puzzling complexity was due to the underlying logic and mechanism of such field. However, after taking some time to absorb the great applicability of Deep Learning in general and Neural Networks in particular, I started to grow interest in leveraging it into solving Data Science problems.

Before jumping into the project, I would like to draw attention to the heated comparison between Machine Learning and Deep Learning that might have flashed through our mind, at least once. In essence, while Machine Learning uses algorithm to decode medium-to-large-scale data to make decisions, Deep Learning creates multi-layer neural networks that take longer time to train to produce higher-accuracy models.

I have tried my hands on both a classic machine learning model and a basic multilayer perceptron model to predict the prices of several AIR BNB properties and tried evaluating the performance of each model as well.

**Dataset**

The dataset here in our hand is AIR BNB dataset which is publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction). You can have a look at it for your reference.
